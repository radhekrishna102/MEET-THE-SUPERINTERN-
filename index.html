            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m the <strong>Shivani Tamrakar</strong> a student of class 12th from PCM stream. I have the powers of <em>understading of myself,concentration, creativity, and problem solving skill</em> that can save your team from any challenges.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="skills">
            
           <h2>My Superpowers</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Good Understanding of Myself:</strong> I enjoy talking to myself, reflecting on my emotions and problems, and eventually finding solutions. This habit helps me stay self-aware and emotionally balanced.</li>
    <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> I believe in thinking outside the box and coming up with ideas that others may not have considered. I AM AN ARTIST WHO LOVES colors and painting. You can check my work in the link provided below.<a href="https://radhekrishna102.github.io/My-artgallery/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaa3VYVGSIiVWtYUp_RDlQm63D4w85E_HE1mqFpu4kzL23qJh1SvhfkbA0o_aem_-Tca8MJNywzfll65CXkTUQ" > I'm SMILINGðŸ™ƒ.An artistðŸŽ¨.</a></li>
    <li><strong>Question Box:</strong> I am someone who asks many questions. I openly share my thoughts, reasoning, and ideas, which helps in better discussions and decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Monotasking Person:</strong> I believe in focusing entirely on one task at a time rather than multitasking. Whether I am studying or watching a series, I avoid distractionsâ€”for example, I donâ€™t watch anything while eating, nor do I eat while watching.</li>
    <li><strong>Never Afraid to Try:</strong> I keep trying until the last moment. If I fail, I donâ€™t see it as permanent. Instead, I believe, "I couldnâ€™t do it right now, but I can do it another time."</li>
    <li><strong>There is No Easy Victory:</strong> I believe â€˜easyâ€™ and â€˜victoryâ€™ are opposites. Success requires effort, and the hard work behind it is something only the achiever knows.</li>
    <li><strong>I am a Competitive Person:</strong> I have always been competitive, but I believe in **healthy competition** that motivates improvement rather than creating rivalry.</li>
    <li><strong>Ready to Acknowledge My Mistakes:</strong> As a human being, I make mistakes. The first step is to accept them, which I do. After that, I focus on learning and avoid repeating them.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> I have strong communication skills. I have given speeches for Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations. I also anchored a cultural event. Besides academics, I participated in various competitions such as rangoli, sports, essay writing, group dance (as a kid), drawing, Ganesh-making, and fancy dress competitions.</li>
    <li><strong>Class 10th Score:</strong> I scored 91.6% in my Class 10 board exams, which reflects my dedication and hard work.</li>
    <li><strong>General Attributes:</strong> I am honest, down-to-earth, and empathetic. I have a tendency to help others without hurting myself. I value my own opinions while respecting others' perspectives. Additionally, I have Emotional Intelligence (EQ) that helps me handle situations wisely.</li>
</ul>


<<h2>Failures and Learnings</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Late Acknowledgment of Mistakes:</strong> There were times when I took longer to recognize my mistakes, let emotions take over, or couldnâ€™t solve problems immediately. However, I learned that sooner or later, I can and will handle challenges effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Procrastination:</strong> At times, I procrastinated, which negatively affected my progress. This experience taught me to manage my time better and prioritize tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Rejection:</strong> My speech for Independence Day was initially rejected, but I didnâ€™t give up. I kept participating in different activities, and eventually, in 11th grade, I was selected for a prestigious occasion.</li>
    <li><strong> Messed up situation:</strong> When I was 15, I participated in a youth speech competition and was asked to speak without a script in front of a large audience. I messed up at the start, forgot my opening lines, and felt nervous. But I didnâ€™t run awayâ€”I gathered my courage and completed the speech. Recently, I spoke at a school event without proper preparation or written notes, and I delivered it confidently.</li>
</ul>
